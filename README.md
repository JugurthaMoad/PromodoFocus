  <h3>What I learned: </h3>
  This project allowed me to learn ReactJS Hooks such as "UseRef" by using it as a simple variable to store data and not lose it value after each rendering , and some cool principles such as " Conditional Rendering" to hide or show elements, "Lifting the state up" to have a single source of trouth, also i learned how to combine Components principle and SVG's to create a reusible icons and the use of the spread operator to copy props :sunglasses::sunglasses:.
